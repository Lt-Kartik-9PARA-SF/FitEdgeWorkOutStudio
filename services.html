    <div class="grid-container-item">
        <h2 class="heading">Personal Training</h2>
        <p>A personal trainer does work one-to-one with a client for prolonged periods of time. A personal trainer will work with a client, designing them a long-term programme which often follows quite thorough fitness assessments. The personal trainer won’t just design this long-term programme, but they will then deliver it one-to-one. So, whilst a gym instructor is writing very basic programmes and showing people how to use equipment, a personal trainer will write advanced programmes and will take the client one-to-one through each session. This could be an hour-long session which might include a range of different, advanced cardiovascular resistance techniques. The personal trainer will be there every step of the way one-to-one to support the client.</p>

    <div class="grid-container-item">
        <h2 class="heading">General Trainer</h2>
        <p> A General Trainer will instruct healthy adults on how to use pieces of gym equipment. This could be cardiovascular machines, resistance machines, free weights etc. A gym instructor will show healthy adults how to use these pieces of machinery and will write them a basic programme that will allow them to move around a gym and follow an exercise programme suited to them.</p>

    <div class="grid-container-item">
        <h2 class="heading">Cardio Training</h2>
        <p>Cardio exercise can benefit brain and joint health. One study reported that physical activity may reduce dementia risk, no matter what age you are. Other benefits include:

            Increases blood flow and decreases chances of stroke.
            Improves memory and thinking ability.
            Combats decline in brain functioning with age.
            Helps protect against developing Alzheimer’s disease.
            Fights osteoporosis and reduces chances for a hip fracture.
            Helps manage arthritis discomfort and maintains joint range of motion.</p>

    <div class="grid-container-item">
        <h2 class="heading">Group Classes</h2>
        <p>Group fitness is a great way to get a workout in without having to think or plan. Each class is structured with a warm-up, a balanced workout and a cool-down.

            The warm-up is designed to help you properly raise your heart rate while loosening your joints and muscles before jumping into strenuous activity. The instructor will coach you through each segment of the workout. The cool-down will help you safely lower your heart rate and stretch all the major muscles worked during class.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">Yoga</h2>
            <p>
                Yoga, an ancient practice and meditation, has become increasingly popular in today's busy society. For many people, yoga provides a retreat from their chaotic and busy lives. This is true whether you're practicing downward facing dog posture on a mat in your bedroom, in an ashram in India or even in New York City's Times Square. Yoga provides many other mental and physical benefits. Some of these extend to the kitchen table.</p>

    <div class="grid-container-item">
        <h2 class="heading">Zumba</h2>
        <p>Designed as a combination of salsa and aerobics, there’s no right or wrong way to do Zumba. As long as you move to the beat of the music, you’re participating in the exercise.

            And since Zumba involves movement of the entire body — from your arms to your shoulders and to your feet — you’ll get a full-body workout that doesn’t feel like work.</p>
